# Rustica Extensions

The Extensions crate provides optional extensions and plugins for the Rustica engine.

## Overview

Rustica Extensions is designed to house optional components and plugins that extend the core functionality of the Rustica engine. This modular approach allows users to include only the features they need, keeping the core engine lightweight.

## Current Status

This crate is currently a placeholder for future extensions. It is intentionally left empty as per project requirements, with functionality to be added in future releases.

## Planned Extensions

Future versions of this crate may include:

- **Physics Engine Integration**: Wrappers for popular physics engines
- **Audio Systems**: Sound playback and spatial audio
- **Networking**: Multiplayer and networked game capabilities
- **UI Systems**: User interface components and layouts
- **Scripting Support**: Integration with scripting languages
- **Asset Importers**: Support for various 3D model and texture formats
- **Animation Systems**: Skeletal animation and keyframe interpolation

## Planned Usage

```rust
// This is a preview of the planned API (not yet implemented)
use rustica_core::Engine;
use rustica_extensions::physics::PhysicsPlugin;
use rustica_extensions::audio::AudioPlugin;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Initialize the engine
    let mut engine = Engine::new()?;
    
    // Add extensions
    engine.add_plugin(PhysicsPlugin::new());
    engine.add_plugin(AudioPlugin::new());
    
    // Run the engine
    engine.run()?;
    
    Ok(())
}
```

## Integration

The Extensions crate will integrate with:
- **Core Crate**: To extend the core engine functionality
- **Foundation Crate**: For basic data structures and utilities
- **Render Crate**: To extend rendering capabilities
- **Graphics Crate**: To add new graphics features
