# Rustica Game Engine Planning

This directory contains planning materials for the Rustica game engine project. It provides a structure for managing the backlog, sprints, and development process.

## Contents

### Backlog

The [backlog.md](./backlog.md) file contains the prioritized list of all features, enhancements, and tasks for the Rustica engine. It's organized by priority levels and categories, with a focus on building an incremental path to a working starfield demo and eventually a high-performance Rust game engine.

Key areas in the backlog:
- Critical bug fixes
- MVP starfield implementation
- Basic rendering capabilities
- Core ECS enhancements
- Starfield enhancements
- Cube/environment rendering
- Advanced rendering features (Vulkan, ray tracing)
- Tooling and developer experience

### Bugs

The [bugs.md](./bugs.md) file tracks known bugs, issues, and compiler warnings in the project. Each issue is categorized by severity and includes details on where it occurs and potential remediation steps.

### Definition of Done

The [definition_of_done.md](./definition_of_done.md) outlines the criteria that must be met for any work item to be considered "Done". This ensures quality, maintainability, and consistency across the project.

### Sprints

The [sprints](./sprints) directory contains individual sprint planning files. Each sprint file includes:
- Sprint goal and duration
- Sprint backlog items
- Status tracking
- Blockers and risks
- Retrospective notes
- Definition of done checks

## Working with the Planning Materials

1. **Updating the Backlog**: When new features or tasks are identified, add them to the backlog with appropriate priorities.

2. **Sprint Planning**: At the start of each sprint, create a new sprint file in the sprints directory with tasks selected from the backlog.

3. **Tracking Progress**: Update the status of sprint items regularly.

4. **Bug Tracking**: When new bugs are identified, add them to bugs.md with appropriate details.

5. **Sprint Review**: At the end of each sprint, conduct a retrospective and document the outcomes in the sprint file.

## Guidelines

- Work on tasks according to their priority
- Complete tasks incrementally rather than taking on multiple large changes
- Test frequently and thoroughly
- Update documentation as needed
- Ensure all code adheres to the implementation rules and coding standards
