# Sprint 2: Starfield Window and Rendering Implementation

**Sprint Duration**: April 3 - April 16, 2025  
**Sprint Goal**: Fix build issues and implement window creation and star rendering functionality

## Sprint Backlog

| ID | Title | Description | Complexity | Status | Assignee | Notes |
|----|-------|-------------|------------|--------|----------|-------|
| BUG-004 | Fix starfield example imports | Correct dependency management in starfield example to properly use rustica prelude | Low | Planned |  | Direct imports are causing compilation failures |
| BUG-005 | Clean up compiler warnings | Address unused imports, variables and dead code warnings | Low | Planned |  | Several warnings across multiple crates |
| MVP-002 | Window creation | Implement basic window creation and management | Medium | Planned |  | Required for visual display of the starfield |
| MVP-003 | Star rendering | Implement basic star rendering with points of varying sizes | Medium | Planned |  | Build upon StarPoint/StarComponent structures |
| MVP-005 | Enable app.run() loop | Implement the main application loop in the starfield example | Medium | Planned |  | Currently app.run() is a placeholder |
| MVP-006 | Basic input handling | Add simple keyboard input to control camera or star movement | Low | Planned |  | Allow user interaction with the starfield |

## Sprint Metrics

## Daily Standup Notes

### April 3, 2025
- Sprint planning completed
- Tasks assigned and prioritized

## Blockers & Risks

- The starfield example dependency issues may indicate deeper architectural problems with how crates are organized
- The render system needs to be tested with actual window creation to verify functionality

## Mid-Sprint Review

- Scheduled for April 10, 2025
- Review progress and adjust sprint scope if necessary

## Retrospective Notes

To be filled at the end of the sprint.

### What went well

### What could be improved

### Action items for next sprint

## Testing Notes

- Unit tests will be written alongside implementation
- Manual testing of window creation and star rendering
- All tests should pass before completion

## Definition of Done Check

For this sprint, all items must meet the following criteria:
- Code passes all tests
- No compiler warnings or errors
- Documentation updated
- Code reviewed
- Functionality verified in the starfield example

## Next Sprint Preview

The next sprint will likely focus on:
- Star wrapping functionality
- Performance optimization for large numbers of stars
- Z-ordering and brightness variation based on distance
- Simple camera system improvements
