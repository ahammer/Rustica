# Sprint 3: Debug Renderer and Visual Feedback Implementation

**Sprint Duration**: April 17 - April 30, 2025  
**Sprint Goal**: Implement a wgpu-based debug renderer and get stars visible on screen to provide visual feedback for the Rustica engine.

## Sprint Metrics

- **Total Story Points**: 16
- **Velocity Target**: 16 points
- **Completed Points**: 0 (Sprint planning phase)

## Daily Standup Notes

### April 17, 2025
- Sprint planning completed
- Tasks assigned and prioritized
- Decision made to use wgpu for debug renderer

## Blockers & Risks

- wgpu integration may introduce new dependencies and complexity
- The debug renderer needs to be designed for easy integration with the existing architecture
- Window event handling needs to be properly connected to the render loop

## Mid-Sprint Review

- Scheduled for April 24, 2025
- Review progress and adjust sprint scope if necessary

## Retrospective Notes

To be filled at the end of the sprint.

### What went well

### What could be improved

### Action items for next sprint

## Technical Details

### Debug Renderer Architecture

The new `rustica_debug_render` crate will:

- Use wgpu for hardware-accelerated rendering
- Provide primitives for 2D drawing (points, lines, rectangles)
- Include specialized star rendering functionality
- Integrate with the existing window management system
- Provide a simple, immediate-mode style API for debugging

### Integration with Window System

The debug renderer will:

- Create a wgpu surface from the winit window
- Handle resize events to update the swapchain
- Manage the render pipeline and resources
- Present frames to the window

### Star Rendering Implementation

Stars will be rendered as:

- Points or textured quads depending on configuration
- Vary in size based on the star properties
- Support different colors and brightness
- Be batched for efficient rendering

### App Run Loop

The main application loop will:

- Process window events
- Update game state through ECS systems
- Render frame using the debug renderer
- Handle timing and delta calculations

## Testing Notes

- Unit tests will be written alongside implementation
- Manual testing of window creation and star rendering
- Visual verification of stars displayed on screen
- Performance testing for star batching

## Definition of Done Check

For this sprint, all items must meet the following criteria:
- Code passes all tests
- No compiler warnings or errors
- Documentation updated
- Code reviewed
- Functionality verified visually in the starfield example

## Next Sprint Preview

The next sprint will likely focus on:
- Star movement and physics system
- Camera controls and movement
- Star wrapping functionality
- Performance optimization
- Z-ordering and depth effects
