# Sprint 1: Starfield MVP Foundation

**Sprint Duration**: March 20 - April 2, 2025  
**Sprint Goal**: Fix critical bugs and implement core functionality for a minimal working starfield demo

## Sprint Backlog

| ID | Title | Description | Complexity | Status | Assignee | Notes |
|----|-------|-------------|------------|--------|----------|-------|
| BUG-001 | ~~Fix rustica_math module imports~~ | ~~Fix unresolved import `rustica_core` in rustica_math/src/plugin.rs~~ | Low | Completed |  | Resolved by migrating to cgmath library |
| BUG-002 | ~~Update workspace resolver~~ | ~~Configure workspace to use resolver "2" to match edition 2021~~ | Low | Completed |  | Resolved: resolver = "2" already set in Cargo.toml |
| BUG-003 | ~~Clean up unused imports~~ | ~~Remove unused imports in rustica_core~~ | Low | Completed |  | Removed unused CoreError import in app.rs and prefixed unused app variable in lib.rs |
| MVP-001 | ~~Basic Renderer interface~~ | ~~Create a minimal rendering interface for displaying points/stars~~ | Medium | Completed |  | Implemented StarPoint and StarComponent types, enhanced Renderer with starfield rendering capabilities |
| MVP-004 | ~~Position/Velocity system~~ | ~~Implement system for updating positions based on velocities~~ | Medium | Completed |  | Created Position/Velocity components, update systems, and added boundary wrapping functionality |
| ECS-001 | ~~Complete component storage~~ | ~~Finalize component storage implementation~~ | Medium | Completed |  | Implemented type-erased component storage, added resource management, and proper entity lifecycle handling |

## Sprint Metrics

- **Total Story Points**: 6
- **Velocity Target**: 6 points

## Daily Standup Notes

### March 20, 2025
- Sprint planning completed
- Tasks assigned and prioritized
- Development environment setup
- Confirmed that rustica_math module has been completely migrated to cgmath
- Verified resolver = "2" in root Cargo.toml
- Updated planning documents to reflect architecture changes
- Fixed unused imports in rustica_core/src/app.rs
- Fixed unused variable in rustica_core/src/lib.rs
- Implemented basic Renderer interface for stars:
  - Created StarPoint and StarComponent types
  - Enhanced Renderer with starfield rendering methods
  - Updated RenderPlugin with configuration support
- Implemented Position/Velocity system:
  - Created components for Position, Velocity and Acceleration
  - Implemented systems for position/velocity updates and boundary wrapping
  - Added Time resource and PhysicsConfig for simulation settings
  - Integrated physics system with the starfield example
- Completed component storage implementation:
  - Implemented efficient type-erased component storage with sparse sets
  - Enhanced World with entity lifecycle management
  - Added resource management to World
  - Implemented proper entity-component association
  - Added comprehensive tests for component storage and world functionality

## Blockers & Risks

- None identified yet

## Mid-Sprint Review

- Scheduled for March 27, 2025
- Review progress and adjust sprint scope if necessary

## Retrospective Notes

To be filled at the end of the sprint.

### What went well

### What could be improved

### Action items for next sprint

## Testing Notes

- Unit tests will be written alongside implementation
- Manual testing of the starfield rendering will be performed
- All tests should pass before completion

## Definition of Done Check

For this sprint, all items must meet the following criteria:
- Code passes all tests
- No compiler warnings or errors
- Documentation updated
- Code reviewed
- Functionality verified in the starfield example

## Next Sprint Preview

The next sprint will likely focus on:
- Window creation and management
- Star rendering implementation
- Enabling the application run loop
- Basic camera controls
