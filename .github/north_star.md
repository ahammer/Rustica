# Rustica North Star

-   **Vision**: Declarative, UI Driven game engine built in rust, with layered tiers for lower level integrations.
-   **Architecture**: Four distinct API tiers (`core`, `canvas`, `scene`, `flow`). See `project-structure.md`.
-   **GPU**: Modern WGPU backend with type-safe WGSL bindings (`rustica-shader-bindings`).
-   **Safety & Perf**: Leverage Rust's strengths.
-   **Structure**: Code, docs, and project layout optimized for clarity and automated understanding.
-   **Goal**: Enable rapid game creation via declarative interfaces (Rust macro & data-driven UI).
