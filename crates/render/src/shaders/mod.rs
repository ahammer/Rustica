// Shader module for the rendering system

// This module has been simplified to remove built-in shaders.
// All shaders are now created through the custom shader API with ShaderDescriptor.

// No built-in shaders or rendering pipelines remain, as each prototype now
// defines its own vertex types and shaders.
