# Goals for rustica-shader-bindings

This crate aims to provide the foundational types and generation logic for shaders used within the Rustica engine.

- **Core Types:** Define Rust representations for common shader data structures (vectors, matrices, uniforms, vertex attributes).
- **WGSL Generation:** Leverage `wgpu-wgsl` (or a similar crate) to generate WGSL shader code from Rust definitions.
- **Binding Management:** Handle the creation and management of bind group layouts and bind groups based on the defined Rust types.
- **Pipeline Integration:** Offer helpers or traits to easily integrate generated shaders and bindings into `wgpu` render pipelines.
- **Extensibility:** Design for potential future extensions, such as shader composition or reflection.
